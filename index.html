<h2>Why Oslo?</h2>
<h3>Oslo, the city with modern architecture and great seafood!</h3>
<p>
    It is a compact capital city surrounded by the Oslo Fjord on its south side and the national protected forest Marka to
    its east, north and west. Oslo is a very accessible city and Norway’s hub for national and international travel. Growing
    out of the Norwegian egalitarian and transparent society, it is easy to connect with people. Oslo is small enough to
    give people, companies and ideas visibility and powerful enough to be a springboard for growth.
</p>
<p>
    Oslo is a city in constant growth and transformation. A well-developed public transportation system of underground and
    over ground trains, buses, trams, and boats gives easy to access to the city and its surrounding region. The city center
    is easily covered on foot, and city bikes are available throughout Oslo. Located between the fjord and the forest, the
    city offers great connectivity to nature. This is a central Norwegian value which underlies Oslo’s aspiration to be a
    green capital and its aim to become a fossil free city by 2030.
